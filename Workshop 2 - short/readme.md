**Short scenario description:**
Sales orders from different customers need to be handled differently based on the sales order amount. There might be a dedicated approval necessary, before the order can be placed in SAP S/4HANA.

**Before:**
- All sales orders are stored in an XLS sheet
- Employee in sales department is checking manually the status of the orders
- Urgent orders are sent via email for approval, in case they are above a certain amount
- Another XLS sheet is checked to identify the correct approvers
- Approver replies via email to the sales department
- Sales order can be placed in SAP S/4HANA

**After (with SAP Process Automation):**
- Employee in sales department starts the process by providing the sales order ID
- Bot is automatically extracting the correct sales order details from the XLS sheet
- Based on the amount of the order, it is either automatically approved or requires manual approval
- Approver receives notification in My Inbox application and works on it
- Employee gets automatically information whether sales order is approved and ready to be created in SAP S/4HANA
- In addition, whole process can be managed and monitored using out-of-the-box visibility
